### Install Node, NPM & Grunt
1. Download and install [Node](http://nodejs.org)
From the command line:
2. Run `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. `cd` to the CodeForge directory, then run `npm install`
NPM will automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

### Available Commands

#### Build - `grunt`
Run `grunt` to compile the source into `build`.

#### Reset - `grunt reset`
Run `grunt reset` to clean all builds, you will have to re-run the build again.

## Creating Themes

1. Go to `source/less`, then duplicate the file `theme-template.less`
2. Rename the duplicated file like `theme-example.less`
3. Include your compiled theme in any views
